  <p>Welcome to the inaugural post of this project, where we turn simple ideas into ongoing income. The first hack is about creating a basic affiliate site. You don’t need to be a tech wizard—start by picking a niche you enjoy, whether it’s gadgets, DIY projects, or sports gear.</p>
  <p>Next, set up a blog on a platform like WordPress or use a site generator. Write honest reviews, how‑to guides, or listicles featuring products you genuinely like. Sign up for an affiliate program such as Amazon Associates, and include your unique referral links in your posts. When visitors click and make a purchase, you earn a small commission at no extra cost to them.</p>
  <p>The magic happens over time: as your library of posts grows and gets indexed by search engines, people will keep finding your content while you’re busy living life. Consistency and authenticity are key—you’re offering value, not just chasing clicks.</p>
