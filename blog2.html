  <p>In our first post we explored the basics of affiliate marketing. Now let’s talk about working smarter, not harder. The <em>80/20 principle</em> suggests that 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. Applied to passive income, this means focusing on the tasks that produce the most return.</p>
  <p>For example, once you have a blog up and running, analyze which articles or products get the most traffic and engagement. Double down on those topics: write follow‑up guides, create review videos, or launch an email mini‑course. At the same time, use scheduling tools to automate repetitive tasks. By pruning the tasks that offer little payoff, you free up time and energy for the things that matter most.</p>
  <p>Finally, remember that passive income is never truly passive at first—it’s about front‑loading the work so that systems run quietly in the background. Keep your efforts focused and efficient, and you’ll see consistent progress.</p>
